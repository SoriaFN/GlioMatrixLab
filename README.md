# Gliomatrix	
A repository for ImageJ/FIJI macros and MATLAB scripts for GliomatrixLab members (and collaborators).

These scripts have only been tested with our images, our setups. The repo is meant for our lab members without Github accounts to have easy access to the scripts. I do not provide support for these scripts.

Some of these scripts are modified versions of other people's code (such as the dF/F0 macro).
